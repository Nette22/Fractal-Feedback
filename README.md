# Fractal Feedback

Uses Three.js/WebGL to recursively grab the screen and render it back slightly transformed. This is similar to video feedback techniques for creating fractals.


# Source

src/feedback.html - stand-alone test environment

threejs-src - redundant source code for three.js (three.min.js is the minimized version actually used).



## Usage

open src/feedback.html in a WebGL capable browser

## Example

![screen capture](Screen Shot.png "Screen Capture")
